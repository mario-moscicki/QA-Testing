**Project**  
Application for Android food delivery. The cycle in which we test the subscription function. The subscription provides free delivery of orders within a pre-configured delivery distance. The first 14 days of the subscription is a trial period. "Normal" paid subscription starts after the trial period.  
  
**Test Cycle:**  
- Shopping with the new functionality activated. Testing all new features with it.
- Testers, we want to make sure that an essential new functionality works as expected in real-world conditions
- Sites with the 'new functionality' are visible and accessible to customers in the cities included in the pilot phase.
- Customers can log in to the 'new functionality' service using actual payment methods.
    
**Test Cycle Period:**  

1st stage, testing trial period, lasts 14 days. Whether it is visible or becomes activated when you select it.  
2nd stage 14 days later, when the trial period ends - to see if subscription money is transferred.
