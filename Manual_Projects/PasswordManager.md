## Introduction  

1st small project - the task for recruitment process 1yrs ago. I have to explore application and prepare manual test cases as many as possible. This was the second step of recruitment process. I failed on 3rd which was very technical. I wrote these test cases after a short experience on uTest. I never published this project because now (from my experience) I see a lot of lexical errors in descriptions. Now, I am working to correct mistakes and this updates will appear from time to time in Google Sheet
