**Test Objective:**  

Search on mobiles:
The slider on the results page is now displayed at the bottom of the screen 
Cross Channel functionality:
- No store address is shown on the grey button on the product detail page, if the user is not logged in or the item is currently not available in their favorite store or loading the page takes more than 5 seconds
- Logic for store on the button should look first for a saved favorite store  
-- If none exists, check the purchase history for delivery to a store  
-- otherwise find a store close to the billing address

**Logical for: Click & Reserve vs Click & Collect:**
- Click & Collect (= item will get sent to the store for payment and pickup, normal checkout process with a store as delivery address, free delivery, requires login)
- Click & Reserve (= item is available in the specific store and will be set aside for the user, no checkout flow)
â€‹- You can reserve an item if it is in stock in the selected store
- You can order an item via Click & Collect if it is available online and not in stock in the selected store
